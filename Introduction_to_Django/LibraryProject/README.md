This is a library project.
I’m Folashade Bello, and I’m really excited to be paired with you through this mentoring program. I’ve been looking forward to this opportunity to learn, grow, and gain insights from your experience.

A little about me: I’m currently a computer science student, passionate about software engineering, personal growth, and making an impact in tech. I’m always eager to learn and I’m confident this mentorship will be a valuable step in my journey.

I’d love to know a bit about your expectations for this mentorship and how best we can structure our sessions. I’m available and ready to kickstart the journey whenever it works best for you!

Looking forward to learning from you.
